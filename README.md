The app is deployed through this link: https://biography-app.vercel.app/. 

To deploy our application locally, we will go into the biography-app directory through cd biography-app if in the Biography directory. Here in the terminal, run 'npm start'. Before running 'npm start', if this is the first time the project is being set up locally, run 'npm install' in the project directory to install all dependencies.

There are no known bugs.
